### Unmanaged VPS Hosting:
Scala Hosting offers unmanaged VPS hosting, also known as self-managed VPS hosting.

With unmanaged VPS hosting, you are responsible for server maintenance, security updates, and software configurations. Scala Hosting provides the infrastructure, but you manage the operating system, applications, and security settings. This setup allows for complete customization, enabling you to tailor the server specifically to your needs. It's a cost-effective option for users who have the expertise to manage their server independently.
